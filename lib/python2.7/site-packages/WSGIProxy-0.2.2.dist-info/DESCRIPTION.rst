WSGIProxy gives tools to proxy arbitrary(ish) WSGI requests to other
processes over HTTP.

This will encode the WSGI request CGI-style environmental variables
(which must be strings), plus a configurable set of other variables.
It also sends values like ``HTTP_HOST`` and ``wsgi.url_scheme`` which
are often obscured by the proxying process, as well as values like
``SCRIPT_NAME``.  On the receiving end, a WSGI middleware fixes up the
environment to represent the state of the original request.  This
makes HTTP more like FastCGI or SCGI, which naturally preserve these
values.
